# html5-canvas-js-plasma
Old school plasma effect with JavaScript on HTML5 canvas.  
Inspired by https://www.bidouille.org/prog/plasma which does a great job at explaining the concepts.  
Thanks to https://github.com/naipath for pointing in the direction of `window.requestAnimationFrame(callback)`!
